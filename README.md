<h1>QR Code Component</h2>


This QR Code component is created using vanilla HTML and CSS. The component is responsive and can adapt to any screen size. I developed this as a beginner's project from the website: https://www.frontendmentor.io. This website offers a variety of projects for web developers at every skill level. This was a beginner-level project for me as I had been away from programming for a few months due to my studies. I'm excited to share the small component I created, and any suggestions and constructive criticism will be greatly appreciated
